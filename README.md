# EAI License v1.0 (2026)

Copyright (C) 2026 Manuel Levi & Enlightenment.AI

## Overview

The EAI License is a source-available license designed to permit broad use by small entities while requiring a negotiated commercial agreement for larger organizations.

It is built for long-term durability and intergenerational enforcement.

## Core Principles

- Free use, modification, and merging of the Software
- Commercial Use permitted for small entities
- Commercial license required above defined economic threshold
- Weak copyleft on Modifications to the Software
- Explicit inclusion of AI training and model usage
- Automatic termination upon hostile legal action

## Commercial Threshold

Commercial Use is permitted only for entities whose consolidated annual gross revenue, or cumulative capital raised through equity, debt, or grants since inception — including that of all Affiliates — does not exceed the market value of **1 kilogram of gold (99.5% purity)**, determined using internationally recognized commodities markets on the last business day of the entity's most recent completed fiscal year.

Entities exceeding this threshold must obtain a separate commercial license.

## Copyleft Scope

If you modify the Software and distribute it or use it to power a commercial service, you must make the complete corresponding source code of your Modifications publicly available under the same License.

Independent works that merely interact with the Software are not affected.

## AI Usage

Use of the Software as training data, fine-tuning data, or architectural reference for machine learning or artificial intelligence systems constitutes Commercial Use.

Attribution is required in associated documentation or metadata.

## Commercial Licensing

Entities exceeding the 1kg gold threshold must contact the Authors to obtain a separate commercial license.

## Versioning

This is **EAI License v1.0 (2026)**.

Future revisions, if any, will be versioned explicitly.
